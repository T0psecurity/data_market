      Hello, little man. <strong>I will destroy you!</strong> I’ve been there.
      My folks were always on me to groom myself and <em>wear underpants</em>.
      What am I, the pope? Leela’s gonna kill me.

      Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Check it out, y’all.
      Everyone who was invited is here. But I know you in the future. I cleaned
      your poop. I’m sure those windmills will keep them cool.
