## Toxicity

You shall not use the Marketplace to advertise, sell, or exchange any data, products or services relating to illegal or illicit activities, including, without limitation, pornographic products or services, illegal drug products or services, or illegal weapons.

## Data Sharing

The data recipient or buyer will not release data to a third party without prior approval from the data provider or seller.

BigchainDB is not responsible and guarantee quality of data provided by the sellers.

## Delivery of the Data

BigchainDB does not host in its premises the data being offered or already offered in the Marketplace by the data provider. If the provider selects IPFS as a medium to host data, then the data is stored in distributed data storage which BigchainDB has control over or the ability to manage.

## Right to Remove Published Metadata

BigchainDB holds the right to remove published data if found in violation of these terms and conditions. We also reserve the right to remove published data that are deemed out of scope of the Marketplace. That means data published by the sellers has to be logistics data and consistent with the data categories mentioned in the Marketplace.

## Confidentiality

Each Recipient shall limit access to the Provider’s Confidential Information to its own employees, agents, contractors and consultants strictly with a "need to know"; provided, however, that such parties have executed an agreement with the Recipient with confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as those contained herein. The parties hereby undertake to ensure the individual compliance of such employees, agents, contractors, and consultants with the terms hereof and shall be responsible for any actions of such employees, agents, contractors, and consultants. The Recipient shall, as soon as reasonably practical after discovery, report to the Provider any unauthorized use of, disclosure of or access to the Provider’s Confidential Information, subject to any reasonable restrictions placed on the timing of such notice by a law enforcement or regulatory agency investigating the incident; and take all reasonable measures to prevent any further unauthorized disclosure or access.
