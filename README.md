## ü§ì Resources

- [UI Design: Figma Mock Up](https://www.figma.com/file/K38ZsQjzndyp2YFJCLxIN7/dexFreight-Marketplace)
- [Planning: ZenHub Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dexfreight-marketplace-5e2f201751116794cf4f2e75/board?repos=236508929)

## üèÑ Get Started

The app is a React app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) + TypeScript + CSS modules and will connect to Ocean components in Pacific by default.

To start local development:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/dexfreight.git
cd dexfreight

npm install
npm start
```

This will launch the app under [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Depending on your configuration, you might have to increase the amount of `inotify` watchers:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

### Local Spree components with Barge

If you prefer to connect to locally running components instead of remote connections to Ocean's network, you can spin up [`barge`](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) and use a local Spree network in another terminal before running `npm start`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/barge.git
cd barge

# startup with local Spree node
./start_ocean.sh --no-commons
```

This will take some time on first start, and at the end you need to copy the generated contract artifacts out of the Docker container. To do so, use this script from the root of the app folder:

```bash
./scripts/keeper.sh
```

The script will wait for all contracts to be generated in the `keeper-contracts` Docker container, then will copy the artifacts in place into `node_modules/@oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts/artifacts/`.

Finally, set environment variables to use those local connections in `.env` & `.env.build` in the app:

```bash
# modify env variables, Spree is enabled by default when using those files
cp .env.example .env && cp .env.example .env.build
```

## ü¶ë Environment variables

The `./src/config/ocean.ts` file is setup to prioritize environment variables for setting each Ocean component endpoint. By setting environment variables, you can easily switch between Ocean networks the app connects to, without directly modifying `./src/config/ocean.ts`.

For local development, you can use a `.env` & `.env.build` file:

```bash
# modify env variables, Spree is enabled by default when using those files
cp .env.example .env && cp .env.example .env.build
```

For a Now deployment, all environment variables defining the Ocean component endpoints need to be added with `now secrets` to `oceanprotocol` org based on the `@` variable names defined in `now.json`, e.g.:

```bash
now switch
now secrets add aquarius_uri https://aquarius.pacific.dexfreight.dev-ocean.com
```

Adding the env vars like that will provide them during both, build & run time.

## üé® Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is set up for this project and is used for UI development of components. Stories are created inside `src/components/` alongside each component in the form of `ComponentName.stories.tsx`.

To run the Storybook server, execute in your Terminal:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will launch the Storybook UI with all stories loaded under [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

Every deployment run will build and deploy the exported storybook under `/storybook/`, e.g. the current one matching `master` under [https://dexfreight-ten.now.sh/storybook/](https://dexfreight-ten.now.sh/storybook/).

## ‚ú® Code Style

For linting and auto-formatting you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# lint all js with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all js & css with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Testing

Test suite for unit tests is setup with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as a test runner and:

- [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) for all React components
- [node-mocks-http](https://github.com/howardabrams/node-mocks-http) for all `src/pages/api/` routes

> Note: fully testing Next.js API routes should be part of integration tests. There are [various problems](https://spectrum.chat/next-js/general/api-routes-unit-testing~aa868f97-3a7d-45fe-97e5-3f0408f0022d) with fully testing them so a proper unit test suite for them should be setup.

To run all linting and unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

For local development, you can start the test runner in a watch mode.

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

For analyzing the generated JavaScript bundle sizes you can use:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

## üõ≥ Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
# serve production build
npm run serve
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Deployment

Every branch or Pull Request is automatically deployed by [Now](https://zeit.co/now) with their GitHub integration. A link to a deployment will appear under each Pull Request.

The latest deployment of the `master` branch is automatically aliased to `xxx`.

### Manual Deployment

If needed, app can be deployed manually. Make sure to switch to Ocean Protocol org before deploying:

```bash
# first run
now login
now switch

# deploy
now
# switch alias to new deployment
now alias
```

## üèó Ocean Protocol Infrastructure

The following Aquarius & Brizo instances specifically for dexFreight marketplace are deployed in Ocean Protocol's AWS K8:

**Nile (Staging)**

- K8 namespace: `dexfreight-nile`
- `aquarius.nile.dexfreight.dev-ocean.com`
- `brizo.nile.dexfreight.dev-ocean.com`

Edit command with `kubectl`, e.g.:

```bash
kubectl edit deployment -n dexfreight-nile aquarius
```

**Pacific (Production)**

- K8 namespace: `dexfreight-pacific`
- `aquarius.pacific.dexfreight.dev-ocean.com`
- `brizo.pacific.dexfreight.dev-ocean.com`

Edit command with `kubectl`, e.g.:

```bash
kubectl edit deployment -n dexfreight-pacific aquarius
```
